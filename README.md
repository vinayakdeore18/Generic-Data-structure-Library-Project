# Generalised-Data-structure-Library-Project
Technology used : C++ Programming

Description :
1. This project is considered as a Library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structure.
2. We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non linear data structures in object oriented way.
3. We provide the generic way of implementations so we can use the functionality for any data type of data types.
4. All the object oriented design policies are used in this project.
